## Notebook for data analysis

Data analysis was performed using Google Colab (Google's implementation of Jupyter notebooks). Although the notebook can be run on any Jupyter compatible service or locally, opening it in Google Colab is encouraged as it has all dependecies already installed and it has been developed and tested using this platform.
